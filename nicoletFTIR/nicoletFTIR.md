# Basic Use - Attenuated Total Reflection

## Start Up

1. Ensure the instrument is turned on and the purge gas flow is set to 0.5 SLPM (10 SCFH).  If the instrument is not turned on, turn it on and wait for it to warm up.  If the gas flow is not correct, turn the knob on the rotameter to adjust it to the correct value.
1. Log on to the computer using the ID **WCU36217\labuser** and the password **labuser**.
1. Open the FTIR software by clicking the **FTIR Software & Usage Log** shortcut on the Desktop.
1. If you did not reserve the instrument in advance, check the calendar to make sure it has not been reserved by someone else and use the Usage Log form to log your time.

# Safety Information

# Sample Preparation

Your sample preparation method will depend on the type of sample you are running.  Solids and liquids can usually be analyzed using attenuated total reflection Smart Accessory but can also be analyzed via a traditional transmission measurement.  For solids and liquids that require fine-scale spatial resolution, the Centarμs microscope should be used.  For gases, the Pike heated stainless steel, short-path gas cell should be used.
