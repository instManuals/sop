# General Notes
- The instrument must be purged at all times with dry air or nitrogen only.
- The purge gas should be supplied through a regulator at **70--140 kPa** (10 - 20 psig) and a flow rate of approximately (but no more than) **4.5 liters per minute** (10 standard cubic feet per hour).
- The MCT detector needs to be cooled with liquid nitrogen before use.
      - Time: <40 minutes
      - Tools and supplies: PPE, plastic funnel, 1 L Dewar, LN2
      - One fill will keep the detector cool for approximately 6 hours
- The source may need to be changed periodically.
- The desiccant (and humidity indicator) may need to be changed periodically (typically as preventative maintenance).
- The purge gas filter may need to be changed periodically.  Check that it is green, in which case it does not need to be replaced.  If it is yellow or any color other than green it should be replaced.
